title: "Fix Authentication Bypass for Development"
description: |
  The authentication bypass in backend/auth/api_key.py is not working consistently.
  Backend restarts are losing the bypass configuration, causing 403 errors.
  
  Need to make the development authentication bypass more robust and persistent.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Authentication bypass works after backend restarts
  - Test API key "nextagi_test-key-123" is always accepted in development
  - No 403 errors when using the test API key
  - Proper fallback when database auth fails

failure_summary: |
  Backend authentication system is rejecting valid test API key after restarts.
  The development bypass in verify_api_key function is not being triggered.
  
  Error: "HTTP 403: Not authenticated on POST /api/v1/query"

technical_approach:
  - Make authentication bypass more robust in verify_api_key function
  - Add environment variable check for development mode
  - Ensure bypass persists through backend restarts
  - Add logging to track authentication flow

files_to_modify:
  - backend/auth/api_key.py
  - backend/judge/config.py (add DEV_MODE flag)
