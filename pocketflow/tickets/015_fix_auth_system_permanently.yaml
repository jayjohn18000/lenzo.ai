title: "Fix Authentication System Permanently"
description: |
  The authentication bypass is working but needs to be made more robust and permanent.
  Current issues:
  - Authentication bypass relies on hardcoded test key
  - No proper database seeding for development
  - Authentication errors not properly handled
  - No health checks for auth status

acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Create proper database seeding script for test users
  - [ ] Add environment-based authentication configuration
  - [ ] Implement proper error handling for auth failures
  - [ ] Add health checks for authentication status
  - [ ] Create development vs production auth modes
  - [ ] Add logging for authentication events
  - [ ] Test authentication with both test and real API keys
