  ## Problem Statement
  The frontend-backend integration is now complete with:
  - ✅ Real-time data hooks for all analytics
  - ✅ Proper authentication headers
  - ✅ Real backend data consumption
  - ✅ No more dummy data fallbacks
  
  We need to perform comprehensive end-to-end testing to ensure the complete
  pipeline works correctly from frontend prompt submission to dashboard updates.

  ## Current State
  - ✅ Frontend API client has authentication headers
  - ✅ Real-time data hooks created for all analytics
  - ✅ Dashboard updated to use real backend data
  - ✅ All dummy data fallbacks removed
  - ✅ Backend provides comprehensive analytics endpoints
  - ❌ End-to-end testing not yet performed

  ## Solution Strategy
  Perform comprehensive testing of:
  1. Frontend prompt submission → Backend processing
  2. Real-time dashboard updates
  3. Authentication flow validation
  4. Error handling and edge cases
  5. Performance and user experience

acceptance_criteria:
  - [ ] Frontend can submit prompts successfully
  - [ ] Backend processes prompts and returns results
  - [ ] Dashboard shows real-time updates
  - [ ] All analytics widgets display real data
  - [ ] Authentication works without 403 errors
  - [ ] Error handling works properly
  - [ ] Performance is acceptable
  - [ ] Complete pipeline is functional

manual_tasks:
  - title: "Test Complete Prompt Submission Flow"
    description: |
      Test the complete flow from frontend prompt to backend response.
    steps:
      - Start frontend server (npm run dev)
      - Start backend server (uvicorn backend.main:app --port 8000)
      - Open dashboard in browser
      - Submit a test prompt
      - Verify response is received
      - Check that dashboard updates with real data
    verification:
      - Prompt submission works without errors
      - Backend processes the request successfully
      - Frontend receives and displays the response
      - Dashboard analytics update with real data

  - title: "Test Real-time Dashboard Updates"
    description: |
      Verify that dashboard widgets show real backend data.
    steps:
      - Check Today's Queries widget shows actual count
      - Check Today's Cost widget shows real cost
      - Check Avg Confidence widget shows real confidence
      - Check Worker Status widget shows actual status
      - Submit multiple queries and verify updates
    verification:
      - All widgets display real data (not dummy data)
      - Data updates in real-time after queries
      - No loading errors or 403 authentication errors
      - Data format is correct and user-friendly

  - title: "Test Authentication Flow"
    description: |
      Verify that authentication works correctly throughout the system.
    steps:
      - Check that API key is loaded from environment
      - Verify authentication headers are sent with requests
      - Test both dev and production endpoints
      - Check error handling for invalid authentication
    verification:
      - No 403 authentication errors occur
      - API key is properly included in requests
      - Both dev and production endpoints work
      - Error handling works for auth failures

  - title: "Test Error Handling and Edge Cases"
    description: |
      Test error handling and edge cases in the complete system.
    steps:
      - Test with invalid prompts
      - Test with network failures
      - Test with backend server down
      - Test with malformed responses
    verification:
      - Error messages are user-friendly
      - System gracefully handles failures
      - No crashes or infinite loading states
      - Proper fallback behavior

testing:
  - title: "Load Testing"
    description: |
      Test the system under load to ensure it performs well.
    steps:
      - Submit multiple concurrent queries
      - Monitor response times
      - Check for memory leaks
      - Verify system stability
    verification:
      - System handles concurrent requests
      - Response times remain acceptable
      - No memory leaks or crashes
      - System remains stable under load

  - title: "User Experience Testing"
    description: |
      Test the complete user experience from a user perspective.
    steps:
      - Test complete user workflow
      - Check loading states and transitions
      - Verify error messages are helpful
      - Test on different devices/browsers
