title: "Automate Backend Restart with Proper Configuration"
description: |
  Backend restarts are losing configuration and breaking authentication.
  Need automated process to restart backend with proper development settings.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Backend restarts with authentication bypass enabled
  - All development configurations persist through restarts
  - Health checks verify backend is ready
  - No manual intervention required for restarts

failure_summary: |
  Manual backend restarts are breaking authentication and requiring manual fixes.
  Development configuration is not persisting through restarts.

technical_approach:
  - Create startup script that ensures development mode
  - Add environment variable validation on startup
  - Implement health check endpoint validation
  - Create automated restart process

files_to_modify:
  - backend/main.py (startup validation)
  - scripts/restart_backend.sh (new)
  - docker-compose.yml (environment variables)

estimated_time: "45 minutes"
priority: "medium"
