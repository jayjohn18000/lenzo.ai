title: "Create Database Seeding for Test Users and API Keys"
description: |
  Replace authentication bypass with proper database setup.
  Create test users and API keys in the database for development.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Test user created in database with proper permissions
  - Test API key stored in database with correct hash
  - Authentication works through database lookup
  - No more authentication bypass needed

failure_summary: |
  Current authentication bypass is unreliable and breaks on restarts.
  Need proper database-backed authentication for development.

technical_approach:
  - Create database migration for test user
  - Add API key seeding script
  - Update authentication to use database properly
  - Remove development bypass once database auth works

files_to_modify:
  - backend/database/models.py
  - scripts/seed_test_data.py (new)
  - backend/auth/api_key.py
  - alembic/versions/ (new migration)
