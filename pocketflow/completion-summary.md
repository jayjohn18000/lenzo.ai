## Expected Results After All Fixes

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- Frontend has proper environment variable documentation
- Easy setup script available for new developers
- Clear guidance on required configuration

### ✅ Enhanced Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages for different error types
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests
- Auto-retry for transient network errors
- Clear guidance for common issues (API key, backend connection)

### ✅ Real Data Only
- No hardcoded fallback values anywhere in the interface
- All metrics show real backend data or proper loading/error states
- Clean, professional interface that reflects actual system state

## Testing Verification

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ./setup-env.sh  # Creates .env.local with correct values
   ```

2. **Start Backend:**
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. **Start Frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Test Scenarios:**
   - Submit a query and verify no authentication errors
   - Check that all metric cards show real data (not hardcoded values)
   - Verify error messages are user-friendly when backend is down
   - Test retry functionality for failed requests

All PocketFlow tickets have been successfully completed with comprehensive improvements to the NextAGI frontend system.
